# Trophy Components Examples

This directory contains example implementations showing how to use the components from the `react-trophies` package in your own applications.

## Important Note About These Examples

These files demonstrate how to **use** the components from the `react-trophies` package - they are not the actual component source code. The real implementation is in the published npm package.

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the Usage Patterns**: These files show the props, configurations, and patterns for using each component.

2. **Note the Import Statements**: In your own application, you would import directly from `react-trophies`:

```jsx
import { TrophyCard, TrophyGrid, AchievementProvider } from 'react-trophies';
```

3. **Don't Copy the Files Directly**: These examples are for reference only. Your imports should always come from the installed package.

## Example Components

- `ExampleTrophyCard.jsx` - Shows how to use the TrophyCard component with different configurations
- Additional example files show usage patterns for other components

## Alternative: Real Implementation

If you want to see the actual implementation source code, you can:

1. View the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ts2gamer22/react-trophies)
2. Look at the type definitions in the installed package: `node_modules/react-trophies/dist/index.d.ts`
